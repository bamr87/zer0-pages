The theme ships a single, layered author system so every collection — posts,
docs, notes, and any you add — presents authors consistently: a linked byline
with an avatar, an "About the Author" bio card, and an **interactive**
per-author profile page that aggregates everything they've written, with
filter / search / sort controls.

## 1. Define authors in `_data/authors.yml`

`_data/authors.yml` is the single source of truth. Each top-level key is an
**author key** you reference from front matter.

```yaml
bamr87:
  name: "Amr Abdel-Motaleb"        # required — display name
  bio: "Creator of zer0-mistakes…" # shown in the bio card + profile hero
  avatar: "/images/authors/bamr87.png"  # asset path, OR a full URL (e.g. a
                                        # GitHub avatar). Omit it and the author's
                                        # github handle resolves the avatar instead.
  role: "Creator & Lead Developer"
  github: "bamr87"
  twitter: "bamr87"
  linkedin: "bamr87"
  website: "https://zer0-mistakes.com"
  expertise:                       # optional — rendered as chips
    - "Jekyll theme development"
    - "Docker containerization"
  # profile: false                 # optional — opt out of a generated profile page
```

A `default` entry is used as the fallback for any unknown author. See the file
header for the full field list.

## 2. Reference an author from content

Set `author` in a page's front matter to an **author key**:

```yaml
---
title: My Post
author: bamr87
---
```

When the value matches a key, the theme renders the avatar, resolves the
display name, links the byline to the profile page, and shows the
"About the Author" card. If the value is a plain string that is *not* a key
(e.g. `author: "Jane Doe"`), it is shown as-is with no avatar or profile link —
so existing content keeps working.

## 3. What renders where

| Surface | Component | Appears in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inline byline | `components/author-card.html` (`style="inline"`) | `article`, `note`, `notebook`, `news`, `section`, `post-card` |
| "About the Author" card | `components/author-bio.html` → `author-card.html` (`style="full"`) | `article`, `note`, `notebook` |
| Profile hero + content grid | `_layouts/author.html` | `/authors/:key/` |
| Author directory | `_layouts/authors.html` | `/authors/` |

The "About the Author" card is gated by the `author_profile` front matter flag
(defaulted to `true` for content collections in `_config.yml`). Set
`author_profile: false` on a page to hide it.

### Reusing the component directly

`components/author-card.html` is the rendering primitive. Drop it anywhere:

```liquid
{% include components/author-card.html author=page.author style="inline" %}
{% include components/author-card.html author="bamr87" style="full" %}
{% include components/author-card.html author=post.author style="inline" show_avatar=false %}
```

Parameters: `style` (`inline`/`compact`/`full`), `link`, `show_avatar`,
`show_bio`, `show_social`, `show_expertise`, `avatar_size`, `name_itemprop`.

## 4. Profile pages

Each author gets a page at `/authors/:key/` that lists **all** of their content
across every collection (matched by author key, `name`, or `display_name`), and
they're all linked from the `/authors/` directory.

These pages are created two ways:

1. **Automatically** by `_plugins/author_pages_generator.rb` during a normal
   `jekyll build`. Opt a single author out with `profile: false`, or disable the
   generator entirely with `authors: { generate_pages: false }` in `_config.yml`.
2. **As committed stub pages** with an explicit `/authors/:key/` permalink —
   useful on GitHub Pages' classic builder, which runs in *safe mode* and does
   not load custom plugins. The generator detects existing pages **and
   collection documents** and skips them, so there are no duplicates. (This
   site builds with custom plugins enabled and relies on the generator.)

To add a profile for a new author on a safe-mode site, commit a stub page:

```yaml
---
layout: author
author_key: yourkey
title: Your Name
permalink: /authors/yourkey/
sidebar: false
hide_intro: true
---
```

## 5. The interactive profile page

Every `/authors/:key/` page is a live dashboard, not a static list — all
client-side, with no build step and a graceful no-JS fallback:

![The interactive author profile page: a hero with avatar, bio and blurb, a stats dashboard that doubles as per-collection type filters, plus a search box, sort control and a clickable topic cloud](/assets/images/docs/author-profiles/interactive-profile.png)

- **Hero** — avatar, name, role, the `tagline` blurb, bio, `location`,
  last-active date, expertise chips, and social links.
- **Stats dashboard** — one card per collection the author has written in
  (Posts, Docs, Notes, …) plus an "All" card. The cards *are* the type filter:
  click one to show only that collection.
- **Search** — filters by title and tags as you type.
- **Sort** — newest, oldest, or title A–Z.
- **Topics** — a clickable tag cloud; pick a topic to narrow the grid.
- **Live count + clear** — "Showing N of M" (announced to screen readers via
  `aria-live`), plus a Clear control whenever a filter is active.
- **Deep links** — the active type filter is reflected in the URL hash
  (e.g. `/authors/bamr87/#type=docs`), so a filtered view is shareable.

Behaviour lives in `assets/js/author-profile.js`, which self-activates on the
`[data-author-profile]` container (safe to load anywhere). With JavaScript
disabled, every contribution still renders in a normal grid (fully crawlable),
and all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 6. AI author personas

An author can be an **AI agent persona**. Mark it with `ai: true` and give it a
`persona` block. The theme then renders an "AI" badge on every byline and card,
shows the authorship `disclosure` on the profile hero and in the
"About the Author" box, and surfaces the persona's custom `topics`.

![Cassandra's interactive profile page: a red shield avatar, an "AI AUTHOR" badge beside the name, custom security topics, and a violet-bordered AI-authorship disclosure](/assets/images/docs/author-profiles/ai-persona-profile.png)

```yaml
cassandra:
  name: "Cassandra"
  ai: true
  role: "AI Security Analyst"
  avatar: "/images/authors/cassandra.svg"
  topics: [Security, Threat modeling, Supply chain]
  persona:
    archetype: "Paranoid security catastrophist"
    voice: "Urgent, ominous, first-person; escalates trivial gaps to catastrophe."
    signature_moves: ["Reframes the mundane as a critical attack surface"]
    avoids: ["Reassurance of any kind"]
    disclosure: "Cassandra is an AI author persona. Posts are AI-generated…"
```

The `persona` block **is** the reusable template. When an AI agent writes a post
it adopts that persona using
[`.github/prompts/ai-author.prompt.md`](https://github.com/bamr87/zer0-mistakes/blob/main/.github/prompts/ai-author.prompt.md)
and sets `author: <persona key>` in the post front matter — adding a new persona
needs no code changes.

The theme ships two example personas (see their profiles at `/authors/cassandra/`
and `/authors/vega/`):

- **Cassandra** — a paranoid *AI Security Analyst* who escalates trivial gaps
  (a favicon, a trailing slash) into civilization-ending breaches.
- **Vega** — an enthusiastic *AI Data Analyst* who fits Bayesian hierarchical
  models and UMAP embeddings to gloriously trivial data.

**Transparency first:** AI authorship is always disclosed visibly — the badge
and disclosure are not optional and never hidden.

### Per-author preview art style

An AI author can also own a **distinct art style** for its generated preview
banners. Add a `preview:` block to the author and the
[[_docs/features/preview-image-generator|preview-image generator]]
will use those settings **instead of** the site-wide `preview_images` config
(`_config.yml`) — but only
for posts that set `author: <that key>`. Every other post keeps the default
style.

```yaml
cassandra:
  ai: true
  # …persona…
  preview:
    style: "dark cinematic security-operations noir, ominous mood, deep crimson-and-charcoal palette"
    style_modifiers: "heavy vignette, red alert glow, faint scanlines, sense of imminent threat"
    # optional, bash generator only:
    # size: "1536x1024"
    # quality: "auto"
    # model: "gpt-image-2"
```

So Cassandra's banners come out as ominous security-ops noir while Vega's glow
with vibrant data-visualization colour — each recognisably hers, with no
front-matter changes per post. The override is resolved per file at generation
time by both the canonical Bash generator
(`scripts/features/generate-preview-images`) and the Python implementation
(`scripts/lib/preview_generator.py`); regenerate an existing banner with
`--force`.

Two real banners generated for these personas — same generator, same prompt
plumbing, two unmistakable looks:

| Cassandra — hand-inked noir graphic novel | Vega — glossy isometric 3D infographic |
| --- | --- |
| ![Cassandra preview banner: a dark, high-contrast noir comic scene — a trench-coated figure in a doorway, a looming hand, and a favicon glowing blood-red in a trapdoor](/assets/images/previews/your-favicon-ico-is-an-unlocked-door-to-total-coll.jpg) | ![Vega preview banner: a bright isometric 3D infographic — floating bar charts, scatter plots and a Bayesian bell curve around a joyful figure and an espresso machine](/assets/images/previews/i-bayesian-modeled-my-coffee-intake-and-wept-with-.jpg) |

> Generated banners are downscaled to ~1200px-wide JPEGs (OG-card friendly,
> ~300 KB) rather than committed as multi-MB source PNGs.

Precedence differs slightly between the two:

- **Bash generator** (what `scripts/generate-preview-images.sh` runs):
  **author `preview:` › `IMAGE_STYLE` env › `_config.yml` › built-in defaults.**
- **Python generator** (`scripts/lib/preview_generator.py`, invoked directly):
  **author `preview:` › `--style` flag › built-in default.** It does not read
  `_config.yml`, so set the style there only if you use the Bash generator.

## SEO / AIEO

Profile pages emit `schema.org/CollectionPage` with an `ItemList` of the
author's contributions, and bylines/cards emit `Person` microdata (`name`,
`image`, `jobTitle`, `knowsAbout`, `sameAs`) — reinforcing the E-E-A-T signals
the theme already surfaces via `components/author-eeat.html`.
