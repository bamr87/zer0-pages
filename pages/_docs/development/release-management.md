# Release Management

Releases follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The release process is fully automated via `scripts/bin/release`:

```bash
./scripts/bin/release patch           # e.g. 1.9.8 → 1.9.9
./scripts/bin/release minor           # e.g. 1.9.8 → 1.10.0
./scripts/bin/release patch --dry-run # preview without changes
```

The command handles version bumping, CHANGELOG generation, gem build, RubyGems publication, and GitHub release creation in one step.

## Full Reference
