# Giscus Comments

> Add a GitHub Discussions-powered comment system to your Jekyll site with automatic theme detection and privacy-friendly design.

## Overview

[Giscus](https://giscus.app/) is a comments system powered by GitHub Discussions. Unlike traditional services like Disqus, Giscus:

- **Requires no database** — comments are stored in GitHub Discussions
- **Respects privacy** — no tracking, no ads
- **Supports reactions** — GitHub emoji reactions on comments
- **Auto theme detection** — matches your site's light/dark mode
- **Free and open source** — MIT licensed

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Giscus, ensure you have:

1. A **public GitHub repository** for your Jekyll site
2. **GitHub Discussions enabled** on the repository
3. The **Giscus app** installed on your repository

## Installation

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Discussions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **General**
3. Scroll to **Features** section
4. Check **Discussions**

### Step 2: Install Giscus App

1. Visit [https://github.com/apps/giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus)
2. Click **Install**
3. Select your repository
4. Authorize the installation

### Step 3: Get Configuration Values

1. Visit [https://giscus.app/](https://giscus.app/)
2. Enter your repository name (e.g., `username/repo-name`)
3. Select your preferred settings:
   - **Page ↔ Discussions Mapping**: `pathname` (recommended)
   - **Discussion Category**: Choose or create a category like "Comments"
   - **Features**: Enable reactions, lazy loading as desired
4. Copy the `data-repo-id` and `data-category-id` values

### Step 4: Configure Jekyll

Add the Giscus configuration to your `_config.yml`. The theme reads exactly
three keys — `enabled`, `data-repo-id`, and `data-category-id`:

```yaml
# Giscus Comment System Configuration
giscus:
  enabled: true
  data-repo-id: "YOUR_REPO_ID"
  data-category-id: "YOUR_CATEGORY_ID"
```

The `data-repo` value is filled in automatically from `site.repository`
(set near the top of `_config.yml`), so you don't repeat the owner/repo here.

---

## Verify it works

The comment section renders at the bottom of the `article`, `note`, and
`notebook` layouts, gated consistently on `page.comments != false` **and**
`site.giscus.enabled`. Keeping `enabled: true` in the config block renders
comments on all three layouts.

Blog posts (`pages/_posts/`, the `article` layout) and notes/notebooks show
comments by default; docs and general pages do not. Override per page with
`comments: false` (or `comments: true`) in a page's front matter.

1. Build the site with the dev config:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec -T jekyll bundle exec jekyll build \
     --config '_config.yml,_config_dev.yml'
   ```

2. Confirm the Giscus script is emitted on a built post and your IDs were
   interpolated (no empty attributes):

   ```bash
   grep -A1 'giscus.app/client.js' _site/**/index.html | grep -m1 data-repo-id
   ```

   Expected: a `data-repo-id="..."` attribute carrying your real ID. An empty
   `data-repo-id=""` means the `giscus` block is missing or the key is misspelled.

3. Serve the site (`docker-compose up`) and open a post. The Giscus widget loads
   from GitHub, so it only fully renders on a public, deployed URL — on
   `localhost:4000` you can confirm the `<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js">`
   tag is present even though the embedded thread won't load.

## Configuration Options

### Data attributes

The theme's include lives at `_includes/content/giscus.html`. Only the first
three attributes below are wired to your `_config.yml`; the rest are fixed in
the include. To change a fixed attribute you must edit
`_includes/content/giscus.html` directly.

| Attribute | Source | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `data-repo` | Config | `{% raw %}{{ site.repository }}{% endraw %}` |
| `data-repo-id` | Config | `{% raw %}{{ site.giscus.data-repo-id }}{% endraw %}` (required) |
| `data-category-id` | Config | `{% raw %}{{ site.giscus.data-category-id }}{% endraw %}` (required) |
| `data-mapping` | Fixed in include | `pathname` |
| `data-strict` | Fixed in include | `1` |
| `data-reactions-enabled` | Fixed in include | `1` |
| `data-emit-metadata` | Fixed in include | `0` |
| `data-input-position` | Fixed in include | `top` |
| `data-theme` | Fixed in include | `preferred_color_scheme` |
| `data-lang` | Fixed in include | `en` |

### Theme options

The include ships with `data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"` (auto light/dark).
To use a different theme, edit `data-theme` in `_includes/content/giscus.html`
to one of:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `preferred_color_scheme` | Auto-detect from browser settings (default) |
| `light` | Always light mode |
| `dark` | Always dark mode |
| `dark_dimmed` | Dimmed dark mode |
| `transparent_dark` | Transparent dark background |
| Custom URL | Load custom CSS theme |

### Disabling comments per page

To disable comments on specific pages, add to front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Without Comments"
comments: false
---
```

---

## Building conversations with Claude Code

Because comments are GitHub Discussions, you can read, draft, and reply to them
from the terminal — and Claude Code can drive the whole flow. Two pieces ship
with the theme:

- **`scripts/bin/giscus-discussions`** — a `gh`-powered engine with subcommands
  `categories`, `list`, `thread`, `draft`, `seed`, and `post`.
- **The `giscus-conversation` skill** (`.github/skills/giscus-conversation/`) —
  tells Claude Code how to read a page's thread, draft a maintainer reply with
  the reader's context in mind, and publish it.

```bash
# What categories exist (and their node IDs for _config.yml)?
./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions categories

# Which pages have comment threads?
./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions list

# Read the full conversation for a page
./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions thread --page /posts/2025/01/21/remote-work-revolution/

# Draft a reply scaffold (thread context + a REPLY section to fill in)
./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions draft --number 7 --out reply.md

# Preview, then post (writes go to public Discussions — always --dry-run first)
./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions post --number 7 --body-file reply.md --reply-to DC_xxx --dry-run
```

The script reads the repository from `gh repo view` and the category from
`_config.yml`; override with `--repo` / `--category-id` (or the `GISCUS_REPO` /
`GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID` env vars) when working against a fork. Writes (`seed`,
`post`) are no-ops under `--dry-run`. A read-only
[`giscus-digest.yml`](https://github.com/bamr87/zer0-mistakes/blob/main/.github/workflows/giscus-digest.yml)
workflow surfaces new comment activity in the Actions job summary.

## Migration from Disqus

If migrating from Disqus:

1. **Export Disqus comments** (optional — for archival)
2. **Remove Disqus scripts** from your templates
3. **Delete Disqus configuration** from `_config.yml`
4. **Follow the installation steps** above
5. **Note**: Existing Disqus comments won't transfer to Giscus

---

## Troubleshooting

### Comments Not Appearing

1. **Check repository visibility** — must be public
2. **Verify Discussions are enabled** on the repository
3. **Confirm Giscus app is installed** on the repository
4. **Validate configuration IDs** match your repository — `data-repo-id` must
   belong to **this** repo (a forked-in ID from the upstream repo will make the
   widget show a "repository does not match" error even though the script tag
   renders). Regenerate at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/), or list valid
   category IDs with `./scripts/bin/giscus-discussions categories`.
5. **Check the config key spelling** — it must be `giscus:` (not `gisgus:`);
   the layouts read `site.giscus.enabled`. The
   `Giscus Comments Configuration` core test guards this.

### Theme Not Matching

The include uses `data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"`, which follows the
browser's light/dark preference. To force a theme, edit `data-theme` in
`_includes/content/giscus.html`:

```html
<!-- Force a specific theme -->
data-theme="light"

<!-- Or load a custom CSS theme -->
data-theme="https://yoursite.com/giscus-custom.css"
```

### Multiple Comment Threads

If pages are creating duplicate discussions:

1. The include already ships with `data-strict="1"` and `data-mapping="pathname"` — confirm you haven't changed them in `_includes/content/giscus.html`
2. Verify page URLs are stable (no trailing-slash issues), since `pathname` mapping keys discussions to the URL path

---

## Best Practices

1. **Pathname mapping and strict mode are on by default** — the include already sets `data-mapping="pathname"` and `data-strict="1"`, which is the most reliable setup for Jekyll sites
2. **Create a dedicated category** — keeps comments organized
3. **Test locally** — the embedded thread won't load on localhost, but verify the `https://giscus.app/client.js` script tag is present
4. **Disable per page when needed** — set `comments: false` in a page's front matter (works in the `article`, `note`, and `notebook` layouts)
