# Keyboard Navigation

The Zer0-Mistakes theme includes comprehensive keyboard navigation support to enhance accessibility and improve navigation efficiency for all users.

![The keyboard shortcuts help modal listing actions such as Open search, Previous/Next section, and Toggle table of contents](/assets/images/docs/features/keyboard-navigation.png)

Press <kbd>?</kbd> on any page to open this shortcuts reference.

## Quick Reference

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Navigate forward/backward through links | Anywhere |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Activate link or button | On focusable element |
| `[` | Navigate to previous section | Table of Contents |
| `]` | Navigate to next section | Table of Contents |
| `Esc` | Close offcanvas sidebar | When sidebar is open |
| `/` | Focus search (future) | Anywhere |

## Skip Navigation

### Skip to Main Content

Press `Tab` immediately after page load to reveal the "Skip to main content" link. This allows keyboard users to bypass the navigation menu and jump directly to the page content.

**How it works:**

1. Page loads
2. Press `Tab` once
3. "Skip to main content" button appears
4. Press `Enter` to jump to main content

## Sidebar Navigation

### Left Sidebar

The left sidebar provides site-wide navigation and can be controlled via keyboard:

- **Open on mobile**: Tab to the menu button, press `Enter`
- **Navigate items**: Use `Tab` to move through links
- **Expand categories**: Press `Enter` on category buttons
- **Close**: Press `Esc`

### Right Sidebar (Table of Contents)

The table of contents sidebar includes advanced keyboard navigation:

#### Section Navigation

- **Previous section**: Press `[` to scroll to the previous heading
- **Next section**: Press `]` to scroll to the next heading
- **Direct selection**: Tab through TOC links and press `Enter`

#### Mobile Access

On mobile devices:

1. The TOC button appears in the bottom-right corner
2. Tab to the button or swipe from the right edge
3. Press `Enter` to open
4. Navigate with `Tab`, close with `Esc`

## Focus Management

The theme automatically manages focus to provide a smooth keyboard experience:

### Offcanvas Focus Trap

When a sidebar opens:

- Focus moves inside the offcanvas panel
- `Tab` cycles through elements within the panel
- `Esc` closes the panel and returns focus to the trigger button

### Anchor Links

When clicking TOC links:

- Page scrolls to the target heading
- Focus moves to the heading for continued keyboard navigation
- URL updates without page reload

## Accessibility Features

### Screen Reader Support

- All interactive elements have descriptive ARIA labels
- Navigation landmarks clearly defined
- Skip links for efficient navigation
- Focus indicators visible at all times

### Visual Focus Indicators

- High contrast focus outlines on all interactive elements
- Active section highlighting in TOC
- Current page indication in navigation
- Hover states for better visibility

### Reduced Motion

The theme respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting:

- Smooth scrolling disabled when requested
- Transition animations minimized
- Page changes instant instead of animated

## Touch and Swipe Gestures

On touch devices, additional gesture controls are available:

### Swipe to Open

- **Swipe right** from left edge: Opens left sidebar
- **Swipe left** from right edge: Opens table of contents

### Touch Targets

All interactive elements meet minimum touch target size requirements (44x44px) for better accessibility.

## Browser Support

Keyboard navigation features work in:

- Chrome/Edge 58+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12.1+
- All modern mobile browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Focus Not Visible

If you don't see focus indicators:

1. Check browser settings for "Tab highlighting"
2. Ensure custom CSS hasn't overridden `:focus` styles
3. Try a different browser

### Shortcuts Not Working

If keyboard shortcuts don't respond:

1. Make sure JavaScript is enabled
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify you're not typing in a form field
4. Try refreshing the page

### Screen Reader Issues

For screen reader problems:

1. Ensure latest screen reader version
2. Check ARIA support in your browser
3. Review [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
