# Fork & Deploy to GitHub Pages

**What you'll do:** stand up a Zer0-Mistakes site you own and publish it to GitHub Pages, choosing between the low-maintenance *remote theme* model and the full-control *fork* model.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account and Git installed locally.
- Basic familiarity with editing YAML and Markdown.
- Optional but recommended: Docker, for the local preview loop.

## Step 1 — Choose remote theme or fork

| Model | You commit | You can edit | Upgrades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Remote theme** | Content + config only | Your pages and config | Automatic (theme pulled at build time) |
| **Fork** | The whole theme | Layouts, includes, SCSS, content | Manual (merge upstream changes) |

Pick **remote theme** if you mostly want to write content. Pick **fork** if you intend to change how the theme looks or behaves.

## Step 2a — Remote theme setup

Create a new repository and add three files. Your `_config.yml` declares the theme and the one required plugin:

```yaml
# _config.yml
remote_theme: "bamr87/zer0-mistakes"
plugins:
  - jekyll-include-cache
```

Add a `Gemfile` so GitHub Pages resolves dependencies:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "jekyll-include-cache"
```

Add an `index.md` with front matter so you have a home page, then commit. The
[[_docs/quickstart/bare-minimum|Bare-Minimum Starter]] covers this minimal file
set in more detail.

## Step 2b — Fork setup

On the [theme repository](https://github.com/bamr87/zer0-mistakes), use **Fork** to copy it into your account, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

Run the installer to reset the config to your own identity and scaffold the content directories:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Step 3 — Preview locally

The recommended loop uses Docker so your environment matches CI:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:4000` to see your site. Without Docker, use `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The docs render with a left navigation tree and an "On this page" table of contents:

## Step 4 — Enable GitHub Pages

1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select your `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then **Save**.

GitHub builds and publishes the site automatically on every push. The
[[_docs/deployment/github-pages|Deploy to GitHub Pages]] reference covers
custom domains and the GitHub Actions alternative.

## Step 5 — Verify

- Your site loads at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.
- The navbar, footer, and home page render with your content.
- Editing a page and pushing triggers a new deploy within a minute or two.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build fails on `Unknown tag 'include_cached'`** — add `jekyll-include-cache`
  to your `plugins:` (Step 2a).
- **Styles or layouts look unset** — for the remote-theme model, re-declare your
`collections`, `defaults`, and `permalink` in your own `_config.yml`; they are not inherited from the theme.
- **Pages 404 that you didn't create** — plugin-generated pages (author
  profiles, search, sitemap) are skipped by GitHub Pages safe mode; see the
  [[_docs/deployment/github-pages|Deploy to GitHub Pages]] guide.

## Next steps

- Customize colors and layout with the
  [[_docs/getting-started/theme-guide|Theme Guide]].
- See the [[_docs/getting-started/index|Getting Started overview]] for machine and
  Jekyll setup details.
