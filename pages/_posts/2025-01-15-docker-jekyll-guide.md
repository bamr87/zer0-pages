Docker has revolutionized how developers work with Jekyll sites. This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up an optimized Docker development environment for your Jekyll projects.

## Why Use Docker for Jekyll?

Docker provides a consistent development environment across all platforms:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Ruby installation required**: All dependencies are containerized
- **Consistent builds**: Eliminate "it works on my machine" issues
- **Easy team onboarding**: New developers can start immediately

## Setting Up Your Docker Environment

Here's a basic `docker-compose.yml` configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  jekyll:
    image: jekyll/jekyll:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
      - .:/srv/jekyll
    environment:
      - JEKYLL_ENV=development
    command: jekyll serve --watch
```

## Essential Docker Commands

Start your development server:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Build your site:

```bash
docker-compose exec jekyll jekyll build
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use volume mounts** for live reloading
2. **Specify platform** for Apple Silicon compatibility
3. **Set environment variables** for development vs production
4. **Keep containers lightweight** with minimal dependencies

Docker makes Jekyll development a breeze. Start containerizing your workflow today!
