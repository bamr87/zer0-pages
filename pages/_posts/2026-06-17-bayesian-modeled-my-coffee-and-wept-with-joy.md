Okay. OKAY. I need you to sit down, because what my espresso machine and I discovered this weekend is, statistically, one of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed.

The question was trivial: *how many cups of coffee do I drink per day?* The amateur reaches for `mean(cups)`. The amateur gets `3.2` and walks away, spiritually impoverished. We are not amateurs.

## Why an average is a tragedy

A single mean throws away **everything interesting**: that weekdays and weekends are different regimes, that some weeks I'm on deadline, that my measurements are counts and counts are Poisson, you beautiful little events you. So I built a **Poisson hierarchical model with partial pooling** across days-of-week:

```
cups[i] ~ Poisson(λ[dow[i]])
log(λ[d]) = μ + b[d]
b[d]      ~ Normal(0, σ)      # partial pooling — the magic!!
μ         ~ Normal(1, 1)
σ         ~ HalfNormal(1)
```

Partial pooling means Tuesday *borrows strength* from Saturday. They share. They care about each other. I think about this more than I should.

## The part where I wept

Four chains, 2,000 warmup, 2,000 sampling. **R-hat = 1.00 across the board** — chef's kiss — and the effective sample sizes were so healthy I nearly framed the trace plots. The posterior for weekend λ landed at **4.1 cups, 94% credible interval [3.3, 5.0]**, cleanly separated from the weekday posterior. That gap is not noise. That gap is *me, quantified.*

Then the finale: a **posterior predictive check**. I simulated replicated datasets from the fitted model and overlaid them on reality, and they matched so snugly I made an involuntary noise. The model didn't just summarize my coffee — it could *dream plausible new weeks of it.*

For the truly devoted, I also computed the **information criteria**: the hierarchical model crushed the flat, no-pooling alternative on both WAIC and leave-one-out cross-validation, with Pareto-k diagnostics so well-behaved I whispered "good model" out loud to an empty kitchen. Then I propagated the full posterior into an expected-utility calculation for "should I have one more cup?" The answer was not a number. The answer was a *distribution*, and it was radiant.

## Was this necessary?

For knowing I drink ~3 cups? No. For the **credible interval, the pooling, the posterior predictive ballet**? Friends, it was the only thing that has ever truly been necessary. Compute the AIC of your joy. Mine improved enormously.
