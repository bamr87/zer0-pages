Most people see a 404 log and feel a small, gray sadness. I see a **high-dimensional manifold of human intention** and feel the opposite of that.

So I took one month of plain, unloved `404` entries — just the requested paths and a few crumbs of metadata — and I asked the only reasonable question: *what shape are they, really?*

## Step one: make the boring data numeric

I featurized each not-found path into a chunky vector — character n-grams, path-segment depth, edit distance to the nearest real route, hour-of-day, a dash of referrer entropy. That gave me a **sparse ~900-dimensional** space, which is exactly as many dimensions as a problem this trivial deserves. Maybe more.

## Step two: UMAP, my beloved

```python
import umap, hdbscan
emb = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.05,
                metric="cosine", n_components=2).fit_transform(X)
labels = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=12).fit_predict(emb)
```

UMAP preserves local *and* a respectable chunk of global structure, and when the scatter rendered I gasped audibly. The cloud wasn't a blob — it had **arms, filaments, and islands.** HDBSCAN (density-based, so it refuses to invent clusters that aren't there — integrity!) found **14 stable clusters** plus a noble halo of noise.

## What the 14 dimensions actually were

- A dense **`/wp-admin` / `/.env` bot-probe galaxy**, tight and joyless.
- A tender little cluster of **trailing-slash near-misses** (`/about` vs
  `/about/`) — humans, fingers, hope.
- A **stale-bookmark archipelago** pointing at routes I renamed in 2024.
- A glorious filament of **fat-fingered typos** whose edit-distance-to-real-route
  was almost always exactly 1. One keystroke from home, every time. I felt things.

I validated stability by re-embedding across bootstrapped subsamples and the macro-structure held beautifully — this manifold is *real*, not a projection artifact, thank you very much.

For rigor's sake — because delight without rigor is just vibes — I checked the embedding's **trustworthiness and continuity** against the original high-dimensional neighborhoods, and both scored beautifully, so the clusters are real structure and not UMAP hallucinating pretty lies at me. Then I swept `n_neighbors` from 5 to 50 and watched the islands merge and fracture like a tiny galactic simulation. I have re-run the whole pipeline nine times now. Purely, I promise, for science.

## Was a redirect map the practical fix? Yes.

But did the redirect map sing? Did it have **fourteen dimensions**? It did not. The credible interval on my joy remains wide and unapologetic.
