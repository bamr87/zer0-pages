A reliable **Git workflow** is the backbone of modern software development. This guide walks through the branching strategies, commit conventions, and code review practices that help teams ship faster, with fewer regressions and far fewer merge headaches.

Whether you are onboarding a new engineer or scaling a distributed team, the patterns below give you a shared vocabulary for collaboration and a repeatable path from idea to production.

## Choosing the Right Git Workflow

### Git Flow

Git Flow is ideal for projects with scheduled releases:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-login develop

# Work on your feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement OAuth login"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/new-login
```

**Branch Structure:**
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `release/*` - Release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Production fixes

### GitHub Flow

A simpler alternative for continuous deployment:

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard main

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/user-dashboard
gh pr create --title "Add user dashboard"

# After review, merge to main
gh pr merge --squash
```

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `style:` - Formatting
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance

## Code Review Best Practices

### For Authors

1. Keep PRs small and focused
2. Write descriptive PR descriptions
3. Self-review before requesting reviews
4. Respond to feedback constructively

### For Reviewers

1. Review promptly (within 24 hours)
2. Be constructive, not critical
3. Ask questions instead of making demands
4. Approve when "good enough"

## Handling Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch with latest changes
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Then continue the rebase
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push your updated branch
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Conclusion

A well-defined **Git workflow** reduces friction, improves code quality, and makes collaboration enjoyable. Pick the branching model that fits your release cadence, codify your commit conventions, and treat code review as a shared craft — then iterate as your team grows.
