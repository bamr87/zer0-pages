Feature flags let teams separate deployment from release. Code can reach production before every user sees it, which makes releases smaller, rollouts calmer, and recovery faster when something goes wrong.

The pattern is simple: wrap new behavior behind a runtime decision, deploy the code safely, and turn it on for the right audience when the team is ready.

## When Flags Help Most

Feature flags are useful when a change has business risk, technical uncertainty, or a staged audience. Common cases include:

- Launching a redesigned checkout flow to one percent of users
- Giving internal teams early access to a new dashboard
- Hiding unfinished work while keeping the main branch deployable
- Turning off expensive integrations during an incident
- Comparing two algorithms in production with real traffic

Flags are not a substitute for tests. They are a control surface for production behavior.

## A Minimal Flag Shape

Start with a boring interface. The implementation can grow later.

```ruby
if Feature.enabled?(:new_invoice_summary, user)
  render NewInvoiceSummary.new(invoice)
else
  render LegacyInvoiceSummary.new(invoice)
end
```

The important part is that the flag accepts context. A flag decision usually depends on user, account, plan, region, or environment.

## Rollout Stages

Treat rollout as a process:

| Stage | Audience | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| Internal | Employees only | Catch obvious issues |
| Beta | Selected customers | Validate workflow fit |
| Percent | Small traffic slice | Watch metrics under load |
| General | Everyone | Complete launch |

Each stage should have an exit condition. Do not move forward because the calendar says so. Move forward because the metrics and support channels are quiet.

## Avoid Flag Debt

Flags are temporary by default. Every long-lived flag adds a branch in your system's behavior, and every branch has to be tested.

Add ownership and cleanup fields to your flag records:

- Owner
- Created date
- Expected removal date
- Rollout status
- Linked issue or pull request

Review old flags during sprint planning or release cleanup. If a flag has been fully enabled for weeks, remove the old path.

## Incident Recovery

The most valuable flag is often the one nobody notices. A kill switch for a risky dependency can turn a major incident into a degraded feature.

Good kill switches are fast, documented, and observable. The team should know who can toggle them, what the user experience becomes, and which dashboard confirms the change worked.

## Keep It Understandable

Feature flags work best when they are visible to engineering, product, support, and operations. A flag named `new_ui_v2_final` tells nobody what it controls. A flag named `invoice_summary_redesign` is easier to reason about in a release meeting.

Small names, clear owners, and short lifetimes keep the practice healthy.
