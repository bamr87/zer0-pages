Observability can sound like a platform engineering project, but small applications need it too. The difference is scope. A small app does not need a giant telemetry program on day one. It needs enough visibility to answer three questions quickly.

1. Is the app working?
2. If not, where is it failing?
3. Who is affected?

## Start With Structured Logs

Plain text logs are useful until you need to search them under pressure. Structured logs make incidents easier to understand because every line carries consistent context.

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "event": "checkout_completed",
  "request_id": "req_4815",
  "user_id": "usr_204",
  "duration_ms": 184
}
```

At minimum, include:

- Timestamp
- Log level
- Event name
- Request ID
- User or account ID when appropriate
- Duration for important operations

## Add Metrics That Match User Experience

Metrics should describe the health of user-facing workflows, not just server internals.

| Workflow | Useful Metric | Alert When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sign in | Login success rate | Drops below normal range |
| Search | P95 response time | Exceeds agreed threshold |
| Checkout | Failed payment count | Spikes above baseline |
| Background jobs | Queue age | Oldest job keeps growing |

CPU and memory matter, but they are rarely the first metric a customer feels.

## Trace the Slow Paths

Distributed tracing is most valuable when a request crosses boundaries: web server, database, cache, payment gateway, email provider. Even a small app can benefit from tracing the few paths that matter most.

Good candidates:

- Account creation
- Checkout
- Search
- Report generation
- Webhook processing

Trace everything later if the app grows. Trace the expensive and fragile paths now.

## Define a Tiny Runbook

An alert without a next action creates anxiety. Each alert should answer:

- What does this alert mean?
- What dashboard should I open first?
- What logs should I search?
- Who owns the service?
- What user impact is likely?

The runbook does not need to be perfect. It just needs to exist before the alert fires at midnight.

## Keep the Stack Boring

A right-sized observability stack might be:

- Application logs shipped to a searchable service
- Basic uptime checks for public endpoints
- Metrics for the top five workflows
- Error tracking with release tags
- Tracing for two or three critical paths

This is enough to make small apps feel much less mysterious.

## Conclusion

Observability is not about collecting every possible signal. It is about collecting the signals that help a team protect users, debug faster, and learn how the system behaves in the real world.
