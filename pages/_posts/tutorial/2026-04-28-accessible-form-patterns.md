Accessible forms are easier for everyone to complete. They help screen reader users, keyboard users, people on small screens, and anyone moving quickly through a task.

This tutorial covers a few patterns that make forms more reliable without adding much complexity.

## Use Real Labels

Placeholders are not labels. They disappear as soon as someone types, and they are easy to miss.

```html
<label for="email">Email address</label>
<input id="email" name="email" type="email" autocomplete="email" required>
```

The `for` attribute connects the label to the input. Clicking the label focuses the field, and assistive technology can announce the label correctly.

## Add Helpful Descriptions

Use `aria-describedby` when a field needs extra guidance.

```html
<label for="password">Password</label>
<input
  id="password"
  name="password"
  type="password"
  autocomplete="new-password"
  aria-describedby="password-help"
  required
>
<p id="password-help">Use at least 12 characters.</p>
```

The description stays available after the user starts typing.

## Connect Errors to Fields

Error messages should be specific and programmatically linked.

```html
<label for="postal-code">Postal code</label>
<input
  id="postal-code"
  name="postal-code"
  autocomplete="postal-code"
  aria-invalid="true"
  aria-describedby="postal-code-error"
>
<p id="postal-code-error">Enter a five-digit postal code.</p>
```

Avoid vague messages like "invalid input." Tell the user what to fix.

## Keep Focus Predictable

When validation fails after submit, move focus to a summary at the top of the form.

```html
<div tabindex="-1" role="alert" id="form-errors">
  <p>Please fix the following fields:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#postal-code">Postal code must be five digits.</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

The summary helps users understand the whole form state before jumping into individual fields.

## Test With the Keyboard

A quick keyboard pass catches many issues:

- Can every interactive element receive focus?
- Does the focus order match the visual order?
- Is the focus indicator visible?
- Can the form be submitted without a mouse?
- Do errors appear near the relevant field?

## Conclusion

Accessible form patterns are mostly about clarity. Real labels, connected descriptions, specific errors, and predictable focus make forms more humane and easier to maintain.
